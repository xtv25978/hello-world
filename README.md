Hello!

I'm learning about Github and how it can help me / I can help other beginners whilst learning Python.  Initially looking to automate various processes I go through as a trader.  As I develop, I'll be looking to incorporate scraping, modelling, and some machine learning using the skills that I will hopefully have learned!
